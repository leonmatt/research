## The Strategy Pattern

The Strategy Pattern is a Behavioral Design Pattern that allows an object to change the
way it behaves at runtime.

The general idea is that you can build objects and functionality in a way so that you can
change the way that you perform operations.

In this example, we model a couple of investing strategies. We have several different investing
strategies along with a TradingSystem class. The strategy pattern means that while we want to invest
our money, the way we invest our money might be different, and the Stategy Pattern allows us to 
change the way we invest our money while the program is running.
